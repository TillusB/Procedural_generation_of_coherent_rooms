# Procedural generation of coherent rooms

This project is intended to generate levels for videogames from preset rooms or tiles.
The main focus is to get rid of stupidly long hallways as we traditionally see them in many dungeon generators.
Also the levels should look like ground plans and be fit onto a preset ground plane.
This way it should be possible to create believable indoor enviroments.
