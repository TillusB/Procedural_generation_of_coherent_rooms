# Procedural generation of coherent rooms

This was the project I made in as part of my bachelor's thesis.

It is a level generator made in Unity3D for indoor enviroments. In its current state it generates rooms randomly, assigns them a type (public, private, entrance) and connects them.

It does not feature visuals, only a layout and logical connections.
